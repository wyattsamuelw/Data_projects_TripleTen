- **Product Return Trends** – Identifying high-return categories and specific products.  
- **Customer Behavior** – Analyzing frequent returners and their impact.  
- **Geographic Insights** – Pinpointing regions with high return rates.  
- **Seasonal Trends** – Examining return spikes throughout the year.
