#### Description:
- Multi-sheet Excel workbook
- Includes raw data, cleaned data, analysis, pivot tables, and visualizations.

#### Process:
1) **Data Preparation**: Cleaned neighborhood and bedroom columns, removed duplicates, and calculated revenue.
2) **Neighborhood Analysis**: Identified top 10 neighborhoods using review frequency.
3) **Property Size Analysis**: Determined the most popular property sizes per neighborhood.
4) **Revenue Calculation**: Calculated estimated revenue for top listings.
5) **Data Visualization**: Created bar charts for neighborhood popularity and property types.

#### Data
The data was provided as a Google Sheets file by TripleTen. A copy can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qdnGCyf_eMhtXXvbPIc8wnz3WIlllL2GnlYvVBlufx8/copy):
- `'listings'`: Cleaned Airbnb listings with calculated fields.
- `'calendar'`: Availability and price data for revenue calculations.

#### Assumptions:
- Reviews reflect rental frequency.
- Only listings with reviews in the last 12 months were considered active.
- Revenue for top listings was calculated by multiplying 30-day earnings by 12.

#### Findings and Recommendations:
1. Harlem, Hell's Kitchen, and Lower East Side are the most attractive neighborhoods for vacation rentals.
2. 1-bedroom and studio apartments are most popular in these areas.
3. The top-earning listing generated $29,940 in one month, estimating $359,280 annually.
4. Invest in 1-bedroom properties in these top neighborhoods for the highest return.
